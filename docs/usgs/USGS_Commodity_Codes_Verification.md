## Summary

We have successfully verified and updated the commodity codes for the USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries for the 1997-2003 period. These updated codes will help improve our data collection system to capture data for all commodities across all years.

The updated codes have been implemented in `grip-backend/src/data_collectors/usgs_commodity_codes.py` and tested to ensure they work correctly.
