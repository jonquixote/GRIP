# Summary of Changes to USGS Commodity Code Mapping and URL Patterns

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to correct USGS commodity codes for the 1997-2003 period and implement a robust fallback system for URL patterns.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/Users/johnny/Code/GRIP/grip-backend/src/data_collectors/usgs_commodity_codes.py`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Corrected Commodity Codes** for 1997-2003 period:
   - Cobalt: Changed from '13' to '21' (as specified)
   - Silver: Changed from '54' to '88' (as specified)
   - Diamond: Confirmed as '27' (as specified)
   - Lead: Confirmed as '38' (as specified)
   - Fixed conflicts between codes by reassigning non-conflicting values

2. **Updated URL Patterns**:
   - Added alternative patterns for 1997-2003 period
   - Added alternative patterns for 2008-2019 period (especially for 2019 variations)
   - Added documentation for special cases

3. **Enhanced `construct_commodity_url` function**:
   - Now returns a dictionary with 'primary' and 'alternatives' URLs for complex cases
   - Maintains backward compatibility for simple string returns

### 2. `/Users/johnny/Code/GRIP/grip-backend/src/data_collectors/usgs_collector.py`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced `_collect_commodity_data_for_year` method**:
   - Added support for the new URL structure returned by `construct_commodity_url`
   - Implemented fallback logic to try alternative URLs when primary fails
   - Maintained existing functionality for all other cases

### 3. `/Users/johnny/Code/GRIP/docs/USGS_URL_Patterns_and_Special_Cases.md`

#### New Documentation File:
- Comprehensive documentation of URL patterns by time period
- Detailed explanation of special cases and exceptions
- Complete table of corrected commodity codes
- Implementation notes and testing strategies
- Fallback system implementation details

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Corrected Commodity Codes
The system now uses the verified commodity codes for the 1997-2003 period:
- Cobalt: '21'
- Silver: '88'
- Diamond: '27'
- Lead: '38'

### 2. Multi-level Fallback System
The system implements a comprehensive fallback approach:
1. Primary URL pattern for the time period
2. Alternative URL patterns when primary fails
3. Main document fallback when all commodity-specific URLs fail

### 3. Special Case Handling
- Special handling for zinc and other commodities with unique patterns
- 2019 pattern variations (mcs-2019 vs mcs2019)
- S3 public path alternatives

### 4. Backward Compatibility
All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing code:
- Functions that previously returned strings still work
- New dictionary return format is handled gracefully
- No breaking changes to the public API

## Testing and Validation

The changes have been implemented with the following considerations:
1. Error handling for network failures
2. Graceful degradation when URLs are not found
3. Logging of failed attempts for debugging
4. Support for all time periods (1996-2025)

## Next Steps

To fully validate these changes:
1. Run tests with the corrected commodity codes
2. Verify that alternative URL patterns are correctly tried
3. Confirm that fallback to main documents works as expected
4. Test special cases like zinc and 2019 pattern variations
